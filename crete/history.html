        <h2>History</h2>

                <h4>Minoan Civilization (3000-1100 BCE)</h4>
                <p>The first advanced civilization in Europe flourished on Crete. The Minoans were known for their magnificent palaces, especially the Palace of Knossos, advanced art, and sophisticated culture. They were expert sailors and traders who dominated the Mediterranean trade routes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Mycenaean Period (1450-1100 BCE)</h4>
                <p>Following a decline in Minoan civilization, possibly due to natural disasters, Mycenaean Greeks from mainland Greece became dominant on Crete. This period is reflected in Greek mythology, including the famous legends of King Minos and the Minotaur.</p>
